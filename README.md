# SICP exercises

## What is it about?
I read [SICP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs). I complete exercises. After an exercise, is done I push the code right into this repo. Hope I won't stop doing this after a couple of chapters `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## File structure
```
chapter (ex 1.1.6)/
┣ exercise1.scm
┗ exercise2.scm
```
