# SICP exercises

## What is it about?
I read [SICP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs). I complete exercises. After an exercise, is done I push the code right into this repo. Hope I won't stop doing this after a couple of chapters `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`

## File structure
```
chapter (ex 1.1.6)/
â”£ exercise1.scm
â”£ exercise1.md
â”— exercise2.scm
```

### What are these .md files with weird Slavic runes?
I decided not to write solutions in English, simply because ~~I am lazy~~ when I write something in my native language I memorize it much much better. So if you want to read it for some reason, use google translate idk ðŸ˜Ž
